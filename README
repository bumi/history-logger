Generator to generate a model for easy (User)Action logging. 
You can use it for internal logging/reporting stuff but also for creating a facebook-like news stream 


Usage
=======

Have a look at the generated model for more information.

Example
=======

class Comment < AR:Base

	after_create :log_action

	private
		def after_create
			UserAction.log_new_comment(:user=>self.user, :linked=>self, :to=>self.commentable)
		end
end



Note:
=======

this code is a bit old and experimental... but it's used in several production sites ;)
